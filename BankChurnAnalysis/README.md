# Bank Churn Analysis

In this first notebook we will only present the data. We will do a descriptive analysis and create some assumptions about why customers leave.

## First Step - Data Manipulation and Data Cleaning.

**Questions:**

1.   Are all variables important for the analysis?
2.   How many customers we have in our sample?
3.   Do we have some missing data in our sample?
4.   Are all variables correctly formed?

## Second Step - Univariate Descriptive Data Analysis

**Questions:**

1.   What are the distributions of the variables in our sample?
2.   Do we have some outliers in our sample?
3.   What is the impact of these outliers?
4.   How many people are left?

## Third Step - Multivariate Descriptive Data Analysis

**Questions:**

1.   How do variables behave together?
2.   Do men go out more than women?
3.   Do younger people go out more than older people?
4.   Do the poor go out more than the rich?

## Fourth Step - Conclusions and Presentation

We observed in our sample a lot of important information for our company. The first idea was that we have many people with a balance equal to zero and this fact impacts the average balance value of our customers.

Secondly, our customers are mostly adults and young people. The average credit score was 650 points and is a good value.

Finally, the majority of our customers are French. And we have more women than men in our client sample.

**Now the next step is to create a presentation and present it to our managers and collect their questions to create an inference model and an MLOps to export the results to a dashboard**
